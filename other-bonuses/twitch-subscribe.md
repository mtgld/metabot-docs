# Twitch Subscribe

Subscribing to [Metaguild's Twitch channel](https://www.twitch.tv/metaguild) gives you an additional 1% to your SLP share!\
The role "Twitch Subscriber" is auto-given after connecting your twitch to discord.\
In Discord, click on the gear icon next to your username to access ‘User Settings’ → Go to ‘Connections’ → Click on the Twitch logo shown and authorize the app. If you didn’t sign in to Twitch earlier, you will need to do so now. This integrates your Twitch and Discord accounts.
